I used Eleventy to rebuild my personal website, and had a bit a headache getting it deployed to GitHub Pages. 

There's not much guidance online. Jonathan Snook has written about deploying an 11ty site to GitHub Pages https://snook.ca/archives/servers/deploying-11ty-to-gh-pages - but rightly or wrongly I thought I'd try and cobble together a different approach that doesn't involve using Travis CI for the build. 

I'm very new to all of this so I'm not sure what's best, but here's how I ended up doing it - hopefully it's helpful, and I'd be interested to know if I could have done it better.

## 1 - Get everything on GitHub

--

## 2 - Tell GitHub Pages I'm not using Jekyll 

--

## 3 - Set the build directory to /docs/

--

## 4 - Change the 11ty output directory to /docs/

--

## 5 - Change the path for images

And js
Find and replace

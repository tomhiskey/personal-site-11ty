I've been painfully aware for some time that some of my technical knowledge is lacking. Things like how to build a website (without using Wordpress). That sort of thing is on the outer edges of my role as a designer, but I reckon if I know more about it it would help. 

So in the last month or two I've found the time to work on it. Here's what I did.

## Learn about CSS grids

I'm comfortable enough with CSS but my knowledge is 10 years old. One thing that was lacking was CSS grids. 

So I learned about them with things like the fun [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/). And I messed around with them using Glitch ([here's my test site](https://gaudy-apostosaurus.glitch.me/blog.html)). 

Using Glitch was so easy and fun - it seems like such a great way to try things.

## Get Visual Studio Code and set up Jekyll

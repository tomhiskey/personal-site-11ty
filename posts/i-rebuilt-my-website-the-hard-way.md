I've been painfully aware for some time that some of my technical knowledge is lacking. Things like how to build a website (without using Wordpress). That sort of thing is on the outer edges of my role as a designer, but I reckon if I know more about it it would help. 

So in the last month or two I've found the time to work on it. Here's what I did.

## 1 - Come up with a project

I decided to focus my efforts on rebuilding my personal website, is a very modest affair with just a few pages and even fewer visitors.

## 2 - Learn about CSS grids

I'm comfortable enough with CSS but my knowledge is 10 years old. I'd never used [CSS grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout). 

So I learned about them with things like the fun [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/). And I messed around with them using Glitch ([here's my test site](https://gaudy-apostosaurus.glitch.me/blog.html)). 

Glitch was so easy and fun - it seems like such a great way to try things.

## 3 - Get Visual Studio Code and work out git stuff

It was time to delve into the murky (for me) world of code editors and Terminal. So I got Visual Studio Code, which everyone seems to be using (I'm sure that's not true).


## 4 - Install Jekyll and run through the tutorial

This

## 5 - Install Eleventy and get the base blog

I understand from [Charlotte Dann](https://twitter.com/charlotte_dann?lang=en) that Eleventy is the static site generator that the cool kids are using. 

So 

## 6 - Tweak, tweak, tweak and deploy

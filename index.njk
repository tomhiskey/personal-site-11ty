<h1>Hello there ðŸ‘‹<br />
I'm Tom, a digital product designer</h1>

        <div>

<p><strong>I like solving meaningful problems, collaboratively.</strong></p>

<p>I have a particular interest in death, and how innovation can solve problems for bereaved families and others during key life events.</p>

<p>I live in York and work in London, where I'm a Lead Product Designer at Farewill.</p>

<p>Feel free to check out my blog and user manual.</p>

<p>So, it‚Äôs been a couple of weeks sprinkled with some joyous things from the world of user experience.</p>
<p>On 22 Jan I attended my first <a href="http://nuxuk.org/">Northern User Experience</a> (NUX) event. This one took place at the swanky offices of <a href="http://www.simpleusability.com/">Simple Usability</a> in Leeds.</p>
<p>The topic was ‚ÄòCan design constraints be freeing and creative freedom constricting?‚Äô. I wasn‚Äôt drawn to the topic particularly; rather the opportunity to soak up a bit of UX and to meet other people in the field.</p>
<p>On both counts, I succeeded. It was a terrific opportunity to hob-nob with some UXers, both at the event and afterwards over excellent real ale at the <a href="http://www.northernmonkbrewco.com/">Northern Monk Refectory</a> (my kind of bar).</p>
<p>Before beer was the fascinating talk by experienced user experience professional Richard Halford, currently at IBM. I was absorbed by the insightful and honest stories from Richard‚Äôs illustrious career, and took away plenty of ideas about the UX process.</p>
<p>My other positive UX thing from the last couple of weeks has been completing in my spare time the online Udemy course, ‚Äò<a href="https://www.udemy.com/ultimate-guide-to-ux/">User Experience ‚Äì The Ultimate Guide to Usability</a>‚Äò by Dr David Travis. As a general introduction to UX, including the process of contextual enquiry, user testing, personas, red routes and the like, I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough. It has set me up a treat for a forthcoming UX project.</p>
<p>It was the first time I had taken an online course, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I felt like a veritable sponge of knowledge. Better ‚Äì for me ‚Äì than reading a book, on the whole.</p>
<p>And I did it all on my new MacBook Pro, perhaps the most joyous sprinkle of all.</p>

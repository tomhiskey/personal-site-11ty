<p>Steve Krug’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321965515/">Don’t Make Me Think</a>” was the first book I read on usability, back in 2010.</p>
<p>The central tenet – don’t make users think – concisely encapsulates UX.</p>
<p>‘Thinking’ is a barrier to users completing their tasks quickly.</p>
<p>Today, my local Sainsbury’s shop made me think. After I finished scanning my items at a self-service checkout and paying by card, I was confronted by the following screen.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Sainsburys-payment-card-edit.jpg" alt="UX at Sainsbury's: stop and think"><em>UX at a Sainsbury’s self-service checkout: I was made to stop and think</em></p>
<p>My instinct was that something had gone wrong. Perhaps I’d entered my PIN incorrectly, or my card had been declined.</p>
<p>As it transpired, there was nothing amiss. I was free to remove my card, take my shopping and head home to cook some curry.</p>
<p>I had assumed (and I’m guessing I’m not the only one) that the big red encircled exclamation mark indicated an error. Put <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=error+message&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjH4Kq2tebKAhWBmx4KHS-6Br0Q_AUIBygB&amp;biw=1271&amp;bih=624&amp;dpr=2#tbm=isch&amp;q=error+icon">‘error icon’ into Google images</a> and you’ll get a bunch of red circles and a fair few exclamation marks.</p>
<p>By breaking convention, the screen had made me think, unnecessarily.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Sainsburys-payment-card-concept-720x852.jpg" alt="Alternative approach - better UX?"><em>Alternative approach – a clearer indication of success?</em></p>
<p>An alternative for Sainsbury’s would be to ensure the screen adheres to basic and long-established conventions about successful interactions. Specifically, the colour green and a big tick.</p>
<p>Wording that more clearly indicates system status – by specifying explicitly that payment has been successful – would be good, too.</p>
<p>Otherwise (I’ll add, just for balance), the often-maligned self-service experience was excellent.</p>
<p>Good UX is like a good football referee – you shouldn’t notice it’s there. Making users unnecessarily stop and think about their interactions slows them down, which can cause frustration and dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The less we make users think, the better their experience.</p>

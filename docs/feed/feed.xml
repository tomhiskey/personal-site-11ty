		<title>Farewell to a law firm’s trailblazing online probate service</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prob8.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Prob8.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; is offline. If you haven’t heard of it, let me explain why it was noteworthy, and why it inspired me while I helped to develop Probate Wizard in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t powered by revolutionary, or even particularly powerful, technology. However, it was a rare example of an online probate service from a law firm that was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumer-centric&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relevant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well-designed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well-executed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Prob8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Prob8&quot;&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Image credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://hallmark-design.co.uk/work/prob8couk/&quot;&gt;Hallmarkdesign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prob8.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Prob8.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; was also a trailblazer. It launched to consumers in February 2010, long before the likes of Probate Wizard hit the market (the firm behind the service, Kent-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehead-monckton.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Whitehead Monckton&lt;/a&gt;, had it in mind since 2007).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It offered a sensible, well constructed, step-by-step, fixed fee probate package to consumers, at a time when online and fixed fee were rare things indeed – particularly from law firms. The branding and user experience were top notch – it was intuitive, fast, modern and professional. It appeared at or near the top of search results for probate-related terms for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prob8 was a bold project for a law firm. It took vision to recognise that an outsider’s input (in this case, design consultancy &lt;a href=&quot;http://hallmark-design.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Hallmarkdesign&lt;/a&gt;), money, patience and a fresh, fixed fee approach to probate services were required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That meant, to a large degree, separating the lawyers from the process of building the service – sometimes a tricky proposition within solicitor practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its longevity was testament to the consumer-focused, commercial outlook of the lawyers and others in the Whitehead Monckton team (I was lucky enough to get to know some of then during my time at The Law Wizard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://prob8.co.uk/&quot;&gt;prob8.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; domain is no longer live and the service no longer features in search results. I suspect the technology wasn’t powerful enough to make the process sufficiently efficient to be viable at a competitive price-point, because, for example, it was unable to compile probate and tax forms, which had to be completed by hand by the WM team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it seems, the Prob8 model wasn’t quite right. However, it was an innovative service, well thought through and well executed – in many ways, a blueprint for other law firms to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A couple of positive user experience experiences</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/a-couple-of-positive-user-experience-experiences/"/>
		<updated>2015-01-30T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/a-couple-of-positive-user-experience-experiences/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, it’s been a couple of weeks sprinkled with some joyous things from the world of user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 22 Jan I attended my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://nuxuk.org/&quot;&gt;Northern User Experience&lt;/a&gt; (NUX) event. This one took place at the swanky offices of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simpleusability.com/&quot;&gt;Simple Usability&lt;/a&gt; in Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic was ‘Can design constraints be freeing and creative freedom constricting?’. I wasn’t drawn to the topic particularly; rather the opportunity to soak up a bit of UX and to meet other people in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On both counts, I succeeded. It was a terrific opportunity to hob-nob with some UXers, both at the event and afterwards over excellent real ale at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northernmonkbrewco.com/&quot;&gt;Northern Monk Refectory&lt;/a&gt; (my kind of bar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before beer was the fascinating talk by experienced user experience professional Richard Halford, currently at IBM. I was absorbed by the insightful and honest stories from Richard’s illustrious career, and took away plenty of ideas about the UX process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other positive UX thing from the last couple of weeks has been completing in my spare time the online Udemy course, ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/ultimate-guide-to-ux/&quot;&gt;User Experience – The Ultimate Guide to Usability&lt;/a&gt;‘ by Dr David Travis. As a general introduction to UX, including the process of contextual enquiry, user testing, personas, red routes and the like, I can’t recommend it highly enough. It has set me up a treat for a forthcoming UX project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I had taken an online course, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I felt like a veritable sponge of knowledge. Better – for me – than reading a book, on the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I did it all on my new MacBook Pro, perhaps the most joyous sprinkle of all.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>UX vs graphic design</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/ux-vs-graphic-design-where-do-the-twain-meet/"/>
		<updated>2015-04-02T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/ux-vs-graphic-design-where-do-the-twain-meet/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s a feeling within the company I’m working for that I am – or should be – a graphic designer, as well as user experience specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking. Where do the two meet? Are they, in fact, one and the same, and I’ve been kidding myself that UX is a discipline distinct from graphic design?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my current project, I am conducting moderated user tests, analysing data and producing a set of personas, red routes etc, to help my client understand its users and the tasks they want to perform – all standard UX fare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not design (not really), but I am also producing a set of specific recommendations regards visual language, navigation and layout. Plus, I’m building a prototype. ‘Design’ may be hard to define, but by any definition this is ‘design’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design is clearly a vital part of the UX process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the context of UX, therefore, I do very much think of myself as a designer, and it’s a part of the process that I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don’t necessarily think of myself as 100% graphic designer, in so far as there are certain design skills that tend to be outside the scope of UX. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing branding, logos and corporate identities;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating the look and feel of a company’s website and marketing material from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, particularly for clients with limited time and budgets, it’s a must for UX specialists to have design experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as these thoughts were swirling around in my mind, I received an email from &lt;a href=&quot;http://nuxuk.org/&quot;&gt;Norther User Experience&lt;/a&gt; about a forthcoming talk – “The role of the graphic designer in the UXD process” – by Simon Jones, a Senior Lecturer Graphic Design at Leeds College of Art, at Simple Usability in Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I popped along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It confirmed what I knew I knew, that UX and graphic design are separate disciplines, but with significant overlap. It would be a foolish graphic designer that does not undertake at least a basic amount of user experience analysis (how could anyone design a website or app without an understanding of the users?). Similarly, it would be tough for a UX specialist to produce something for a client without any sort of design, even if in the form of paper prototypes or wireframes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered flexing my Venn diagram muscles by way of illustration, but why bother when the very clever Janis Yee at &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdx.ca/&quot;&gt;PDX.ca&lt;/a&gt; has done such a good job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/UX-Graphic-design-venn.png&quot; alt=&quot;Infographic by Janis Yee at http://pdx.ca/&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Infographic by Janis Yee at &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdx.ca/&quot;&gt;http://pdx.ca/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out Janis’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/55351/can-you-be-a-web-and-ux-designer-or-a-web-designer-with-ux-skills&quot;&gt;blog post on the subject&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The points of overlap in the diagram are important. From a UX perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UX/UI developer bit means I can produce working prototypes to showcase ideas to the client and users, and communicate effectively with the development team; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UX/UI designer bit means (as the infographic says), I can design layouts, visuals, etc, within the client’s brand values in mind. It also means that any visuals I produce are grounded in decent design principles, be it &lt;a href=&quot;http://digestwebdesign.com/carp_design_principles.html&quot;&gt;CARP&lt;/a&gt;, colour, typography, use of space, usability, emotional response or whatever. This is surely important in terms of time, budget and results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question answered: UX and graphic design are separate disciplines, but there’s big overlap, and, as a UX specialist, design is an important part of what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Managing unsolicited feedback during a user experience review</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/managing-usolicited-feedback-during-a-user-experience-review/"/>
		<updated>2015-04-21T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/managing-usolicited-feedback-during-a-user-experience-review/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently completed the first stage of a structured user experience review, following established and standard-fare UX techniques such as user testing, personas and red routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At once stage, colleagues were drip-feeding ideas, suggestions and feedback which they had received from users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty with this is that the feedback was completely out of the context of my user experience process. It was unmoderated, unverified and – I suppose – a bit slap-dash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, user feedback is valuable, and my feeling was that it shouldn’t be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a bit of advice from peers, so I &lt;a href=&quot;https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/73989/colleagues-drip-feeding-me-feedback-from-random-users-what-should-i-do&quot;&gt;posed the scenario on the user experience section of StackExchange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the replies I got, it looks like I struck a chord. Other user experience professionals have been faced with the same question: how to manage unsolicited feedback while trying to keep the UX process on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One user summed up his approach as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t know the weight of this information or how to compare it to other data. From that perspective it is useless for your own research. But don’t throw it away, it is still real feedback so better take it seriously. Once you’ve gathered your own data, don’t mix it up with this low quality feedback but use it to see if there are similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another said this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build structure with them, tell them that you need all requirements before hand, because this trend keeps going if it isn’t stopped in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something is sent in a vague fashion, ask for more details. Ask for context and more details. If they don’t know, then the data is unreliable. Unreliable data is just as bad as not having any data to begin with (because you can’t really do anything with it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good luck. I know the frustrations all too well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-approach&quot;&gt;My approach &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#my-approach&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach was to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thank colleagues for feedback so far, and encourage them to keep it coming (user feedback in any form is valuable and should not be discouraged);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do a little bit of awareness-raising about the UX process (a new concept for many at the company), for example to explain the value of doing things in a structured, unbiased, moderated way;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;say to colleagues that, while I’m grateful for all feedback, I would put it to one side for the time being and review it later as a means of corroborating/contradicting my findings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a month or so ago. In hindsight, I’m pleased I took this approach. By sticking to a structured UX process and not being side-tracked or biased by out-of-context feedback, I feel I achieved more accurate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I did review the feedback, which (thankfully) corroborated my findings. I also chose to do a moderated user test with one of the users who had been particularly vocal in his feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Clickable progress bars - why different user groups produce different results</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/context-clickable-progress-bars/"/>
		<updated>2015-05-22T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/context-clickable-progress-bars/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My current client asked me to conduct usability reviews into two of its systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first, an online portal used by its customers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second, a similar online portal used by its business parters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two portals (which I did not help to build) are similar in function. The two user groups use the portals to perform similar activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both contain clickable progress bars, not too dissimilar to the following (though in this case this is just a mockup – not actually clickable):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Progress-bars-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Progress bars 2&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The progress bars link to a more detailed breakdown of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I conducted a separate a round of usability tests for each portal. Partly in person, partly online, but in all cases moderated and with the classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa9DLxDtPtc&quot;&gt;usability testing poker face&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were surprising. Customers (portal 1) invariably understood that clicking the progress bars would reveal more detailed information. Partners (portal 2), on the other hand, almost invariably did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the discrepancy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to know for sure, but in my view it’s to do with context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though similar on the whole, there are subtle differences in the layouts and priorities of the two portals. For customers (portal 1), the progress bars have prime position, with a similar clickable bar on the home page. Very little of interest can be discovered if not via the bars. For partners (portal 2), the clickable bars are in a sub-section, not on the home page, and not such a critical part of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also to do with consistency (such a critical element of interface design): because most links in the partner portal are text-based, it takes a leap of faith, rather than an intuitive understanding, to twig that these graphical bars link to further pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, partners do not intuitively understand that the bars are clickable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;low-cost-solution&quot;&gt;Low cost solution &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#low-cost-solution&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that partners (portal 2) struggle with the bars, and not wanting to risk the same with even a minority of customers (portal 1), my solution was to add a text link next to the bars, much like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Progress-bars-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Progress bars 1&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users intuitively understand that clicking the link will reveal further details. (Hover effects aren’t enough: the user may not think to hover over the bars, and they are inadequate for tablets and mobiles.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a simple, low cost solution; i.e. easy to implement without causing disruption or complication to the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple solution aside, for me this is a demonstration that different user groups can provide significantly different results based purely on context and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, it’s no big leap to see why it’s so important to continue to test assumptions through regular usability tests. So the bars are obviously clickable to customers right now, but what if the portal grows and the context changes? It could make all the difference between something perfectly intuitive and something frustratingly not.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Is one ‘persona’ ever enough?</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/is-one-persona-enough/"/>
		<updated>2015-06-08T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/is-one-persona-enough/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;‘Personas’ are fictional characters representing amalgamations of user-groups. They offer bite-size insights into users; a way to empathise with clients without trawling through reams of impersonal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though fictional, personas should be based on evidence from users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A persona typically has a name (made up), a photo (not a real user), goals, a quote and further details, all written from this fictional person’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personas are very common in UX work. They’re also widely used in marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventionally, 4-6 personas is considered about right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my latest UX project, I created just one. Can this be enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created one persona because (a) personas were required for a specific IT system which was very simple in function, providing just one key solution to users; and (b) there was no evidence from users that there was more than one broad user group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though individual users varied (of course), I came to the conclusion that they were so similar that – in this particular case – multiple personas would have been arbitrary; I would have had to contrive them without basis from evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, producing this single persona was a useful exercise: it condensed the users into a client-centric character. It was helpful to the IT team and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4-6 personas is a good rule of thumb, but, in this particular case, one was enough.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How businesses can learn from ‘implementation, representation and mental’ models</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/why-better-ux-comes-from-understanding-the-implementation-representation-and-mental-models/"/>
		<updated>2015-09-30T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/why-better-ux-comes-from-understanding-the-implementation-representation-and-mental-models/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of this diagram as a way of summing up the role of user experience in businesses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/UX-models-TPH-2015-09-231-720x391.png&quot; alt=&quot;UX models - implementation, representation, mental&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It represents three models for software and service development: ‘implementation’, ‘representation’ and ‘mental’. Jargony, but simple to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any business that has developed software or services based on certain internal assumptions, and then seen the end product poorly received by users, may recognise &lt;strong&gt;the implementation model&lt;/strong&gt;. Businesses following this model implement technology, products or services based on their own requirements and capabilities, without paying heed to their users. The result is (almost certainly) poor UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the scale is an end user’s idealised vision of a product or service. This is &lt;strong&gt;the mental model&lt;/strong&gt;, the panacea that a user would sketch out on a napkin if they had free reign. Ultimate UX!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, hitting the mental model sweet spot is usually impossible, because businesses will (rightly and inevitably) bring their own requirements and capabilities to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is usually in the middle of the spectrum – this is known as &lt;strong&gt;the representation model&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s a balance between a user’s idealised vision and the realities of what can be built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a compromise; it’s a reality. It’s absolutely fine and proper to end up with this balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically, though, a UX-focused business will and should do two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, start any design and development process at &lt;strong&gt;the right-hand side&lt;/strong&gt; of the spectrum. Starting with the mental model puts the users’ vision at the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, strive to end up &lt;strong&gt;as close to the mental model as possible&lt;/strong&gt;, to achieve the best possible result for users while satisfying businesses requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses without a UX mindset tend to operate in or around the implementation model. Their products and services often won’t resonate with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business that achieve fantastic UX get as close to the mental model as possible. They’re the ones on the right-hand side of the diagram, and the ones with delighted customers.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A few fabulous UX lessons from NUX4</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/a-few-fabulous-ux-lessons-from-nux4/"/>
		<updated>2015-10-24T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/a-few-fabulous-ux-lessons-from-nux4/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the fourth Northern User Experience conference in Manchester. A hugely impressive event, particularly considering it’s organised by an army of volunteers. 600 UX practitioners (and some people considering moving in to the industry) were in attendance, which probably meant that no actual UX work was being done in the north of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took something away from every one of the seven talks; here are just a few highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fall-in-love-with-problems&quot;&gt;Fall in love with problems &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#fall-in-love-with-problems&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomer Sharon is a User Experience Researcher at Google in New York. His keynote speech was terrific. Three mantras resonated with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Do the right thing, then do things right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Basically, get super clear on the problem you’re solving first, before attempting to build anything.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Fall in love with problems, then with solutions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A similar idea – make sure the problem is perfectly articulated and, until it is, don’t get distracted with solutions. Put the problem you’re solving at the heart of everything you do.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Observe people, don’t just listen to what they say.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(User research! Critical to the process. Surveys and focus groups alone won’t cut the mustard.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communicating-the-ux-process-to-clients&quot;&gt;Communicating the UX process to clients &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#communicating-the-ux-process-to-clients&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny Grinblo from Future Workshops was another experienced and entertaining speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny stressed the power of bringing user voices into the boardroom. That might mean video clips or audio clips from user tests – something I can attest is an important and powerful part of the process. What I didn’t realise is that seeing or hearing users’ feelings direct stirs chemicals in the brain. Which chemicals, I can’t recall, but anyway, there’s science behind the idea that a video is worth a thousand reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often UX practitioners’ clients are more comfortable with ‘how’, not with ‘what’ or ‘why’. So they might focus on minor changes to an unsuccessful product, rather than being immediately willing to delve more deeply into the root problems. It’s up to us to help guide them to the underlying problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storyboarding is an effective way of communicating user needs to businesses. That means telling a story of the ‘what’ and the ‘why’, eventually reaching the ‘superhero’ moment of the solution, i.e. how the product is solving the problem. Six months later when ideas are still flying around, the initial storyboard helps ground discussions back to solving the problem that was agreed at the initial stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruthless prioritisation is key. In other words, not only identifying the tasks and requirements of different user groups but also making the utmost effort to prioritise them, and compare the priorities of different groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communicating the UX process to businesses can be difficult. Asking difficult questions (e.g. ‘how will this product make money?’), explaining the decision-making process and – as a final resort – scaring the client in some way (perhaps pointing out what will happen if the wrong decisions are made), can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;it%E2%80%99s-ok-to-feel-uncertain-(phew!)&quot;&gt;It’s ok to feel uncertain (phew!) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#it%E2%80%99s-ok-to-feel-uncertain-(phew!)&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took away some interesting insight about user workshops, something on the horizon for me in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle of encouraging divergent (no holds barred) thinking before converging on specifics appeals to me as a way of encouraging interaction. As does grouping similar user groups together for different workshops, for clarity on the different users’ needs. I’m also keen to use an inordinate amount of post-it notes… always good to see photos of other UX-ers relying on humble notes and pens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workshops aren’t the whole story (they’re no replacement for user testing), but it was great to hear more about how effective they can be, and the best way to manage them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also reassuring to hear that it’s ok to feel uncertain and overwhelmed by the process at times. But as UX practitioners, if we trust in the process, it will all come good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kindness-is-designing-for-the-worst&quot;&gt;Kindness is designing for the worst &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#kindness-is-designing-for-the-worst&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final keynote was an unexpectedly touching and affecting talk by Sara Wachter-Boettcher, a UX consultant based in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sara referred to personal experiences to stress that unnecessary and poorly-worded questions, and inappropriate interfaces, can not only make a user feel excluded but also rejected and isolated. She referred to a period-tracking app that assumed all sex was happy and consensual and an unnecessary question on a form which asked about sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story is: always design for ‘stress cases’. In other words, consider all your users, particularly the worst off, and make sure the content and design is appropriate for them. That’s the UX of kindness.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Household heuristics – why a flashing light is good UX</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/household-heuristics-why-a-flashing-light-is-good-ux/"/>
		<updated>2015-12-22T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/household-heuristics-why-a-flashing-light-is-good-ux/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Instinctively, we all want software and products that &lt;em&gt;just work&lt;/em&gt;. Confusion, frustration and general faffing about are signs of bad user experience. We feel joyful about things that are simple or intuitive, but when we’re stopped us in our tracks by poor design, things get ugly – fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all intuitively have a sense of user experience, and we’ll all have encountered usability issues – positive or negative – countless times in our lives, without necessarily ascribing them to this thing called “UX”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long-standing and well known list of usability guidelines is Jakob Nielsen’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/&quot;&gt;10 usability heuristics for user interface design&lt;/a&gt;“. Around in its current for since 1995, it goes to show just how universal are the basic principles of good usability and how they persist through upheavals in technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nielsen’s background is in software and his heuristics were developed with digital user interfaces in mind. However, most of them apply equally to physical products.&lt;br&gt;
For example, item one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visibility of system status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my birthday a few weeks ago my wife – perhaps concerned at my increasingly scruff-bag appearance – bought me a beard trimmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A already had a beard trimmer but it was getting on a bit. I was glad to upgrade to the latest in trimming technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were features of my old trimmer that I now realise I took for granted: a flashing orange light when the battery was running low; a flashing green light when the battery was charging; and a steady green light when the battery was charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so in Trimmer: The Sequel. The instructions said to charge before use, but there was no indication of whether it was doing so. A light, a vibration, a beep: anything would have done. My instinct was that I’d made a mistake, but no: it all checked out, and the next morning it had charged. And when the battery runs down, I won’t know until the trimming stops: hopefully not leaving me with demi-trimmed facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback – expressed by Nielsen as “visibility of system status” – is something so basic and so ubiquitous that we take it for granted, and we miss it when it’s not there. I’m frustrated at the designers of the beard trimmer: did this issue not come up in their meetings? Did they do any user testing? Had they ever read Nielsen’s heuristics? These things aren’t minor; they have a big impact on our relationship with a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking around a house, interface feedback is everywhere. From the battery indicator on our phones, to the standby light on the telly, to the LED display on a modern electric oven, to the light on the kettle, to the beep after a completed dishwasher cycle, to the vibration of a linked set of baby monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do all your household appliances provide the best possible feedback? Had you even thought about it? Like most of us, I only tend to notice these things when they’re absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software or product designers would do well to read over those ten ever-so-simple, 30-year-old heuristics from Nielsen now and again. That’s not to say they can never be broken (rules are there to be broken), and they’re no substitute for user testing or a shortcut to success. But life – and my new beard trimmer – would be that little bit more satisfying if they were followed more often.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Build services not websites - design principles from GOV.UK</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/build-services-not-websites-design-principles-from-gov-uk/"/>
		<updated>2016-01-03T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/build-services-not-websites-design-principles-from-gov-uk/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m a little bit in love with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the behemoth online home of the UK government, bringing the nation’s digital services under one roof. An ambitious project which centralises and standardises the web presence for hundreds of disparate agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt; has a unique set of design challenges: design for the whole country; for any and all users and needs; for the disabled; for the digitally non-proficient. It encompasses all manner of services, from car tax renewals to grant of probate guidance, from passport applications to registration of a lasting power of attorney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understandably, it has suffered significant growing pains since its launch in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staggering, then, that this &lt;a href=&quot;http://qz.com/75413/this-government-website-just-won-an-award-for-best-design/&quot;&gt;award-winning&lt;/a&gt; service succeeds on so many levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-focused-design-principles&quot;&gt;User-focused design principles &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#user-focused-design-principles&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;’s design is the Government Digital Service. Its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/design-principles&quot;&gt;design principles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual&quot;&gt;design manual&lt;/a&gt; are robust and consistently-applied across the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other design guidelines available online (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;) – the starting-point of the GDS design principles is content and user needs, rather than a visual language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with needs (of users, not the government).&lt;/strong&gt; If you don’t know what the user needs are, you won’t build the right thing. Do research, analyse data, talk to users. Don’t make assumptions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is principle number one and it’s user experience through-and-through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principles also highlight the critical need for simplicity. Here’s number four:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do the hard work to make it simple.&lt;/strong&gt; Making something look simple is easy. Making something simple to use is much harder — but that’s what we should be doing. Don’t take “It’s always been that way” for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users&lt;/em&gt; – who are seeking to perform critical tasks, as opposed to simply browsing a website, are at the heart of the principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build digital services, not websites.&lt;/strong&gt; A service is something that helps people to do something. Our job is to uncover user needs and meet those needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clumsily sum up in my own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s all about the needs of users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content is king&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it useful, readable and accessible – “prettiness” is not an objective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less is more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;seeing-gov.uk%E2%80%99s-user-focused-principles-in-action&quot;&gt;Seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;’s user-focused principles in action &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#seeing-gov.uk%E2%80%99s-user-focused-principles-in-action&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rule, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt; contains nothing superfluous. Here’s a page relating to applying for a grant of probate, an area of particular interest to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Gov-uk-design-grant-of-probate-768x624.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gov uk design - grant of probate&quot; title=&quot;Gov uk design&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;An uncluttered, needs-focused and content-driven page at &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast the clear, needs-focused design above with a page from the DirectGov service which &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt; replaced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/direct_gov_uk.png&quot; alt=&quot;Old design for Directgov&quot; title=&quot;DirectGov screenshot&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;The cluttered, hard-to-read and unfocussed approach of .gov.uk’s predecessor, Directgov.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the reason &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt; succeeds is the GDS’s unflinching goal to satisfy users’ needs as simply as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge credit is also due to the content-writers and editors, condensing often complex and technical subjects into clear, accessible advice. For example, the grant of probate page, above. The GDS’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk&quot;&gt;Writing for GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt; guide shows how it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/06/gov-uk-isnt-finished/&quot;&gt;isn’t perfect&lt;/a&gt;, but attaining such consistent usability is a hugely impressive achievement, and one – precisely because of its simplicity – that’s easy to ignore or under-appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, successful, ambitious, long-term government projects are rare things, especially in the digital domain. &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt; is something we can cherish and learn from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a wealth of publicly-available resources from GDS. Recommended reading includes:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Sainsbury’s, don’t make me think</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/sainsburys-dont-make-me-think/"/>
		<updated>2016-02-07T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/sainsburys-dont-make-me-think/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Steve Krug’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321965515/&quot;&gt;Don’t Make Me Think&lt;/a&gt;” was the first book I read on usability, back in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central tenet – don’t make users think – concisely encapsulates UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Thinking’ is a barrier to users completing their tasks quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, my local Sainsbury’s shop made me think. After I finished scanning my items at a self-service checkout and paying by card, I was confronted by the following screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Sainsburys-payment-card-edit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;UX at Sainsbury&#39;s: stop and think&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;UX at a Sainsbury’s self-service checkout: I was made to stop and think&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My instinct was that something had gone wrong. Perhaps I’d entered my PIN incorrectly, or my card had been declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it transpired, there was nothing amiss. I was free to remove my card, take my shopping and head home to cook some curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had assumed (and I’m guessing I’m not the only one) that the big red encircled exclamation mark indicated an error. Put &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=error+message&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjH4Kq2tebKAhWBmx4KHS-6Br0Q_AUIBygB&amp;amp;biw=1271&amp;amp;bih=624&amp;amp;dpr=2#tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=error+icon&quot;&gt;‘error icon’ into Google images&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll get a bunch of red circles and a fair few exclamation marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By breaking convention, the screen had made me think, unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Sainsburys-payment-card-concept-720x852.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alternative approach - better UX?&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alternative approach – a clearer indication of success?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative for Sainsbury’s would be to ensure the screen adheres to basic and long-established conventions about successful interactions. Specifically, the colour green and a big tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wording that more clearly indicates system status – by specifying explicitly that payment has been successful – would be good, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise (I’ll add, just for balance), the often-maligned self-service experience was excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good UX is like a good football referee – you shouldn’t notice it’s there. Making users unnecessarily stop and think about their interactions slows them down, which can cause frustration and dissatisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The less we make users think, the better their experience.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The power of UX benchmarking</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/the-power-of-ux-benchmarking/"/>
		<updated>2016-03-28T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/the-power-of-ux-benchmarking/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Measuring the success of UX work for an e-commerce site with millions of hits a month can be relatively straightforward. If a change is implemented in the morning, and sales go up in the afternoon, it’s worked. (I simplify a little.) And with that many hits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.kissmetrics.com/ab-testing-introduction/&quot;&gt;A/B testing&lt;/a&gt; is a potentially powerful resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing quantitative evidence of UX success is not always so simple. For example, a recent UX review I led for Kings Court Trust concerned an online portal for our business partners. Sign-up rates, purchasing rates, amount spent, bounce rates, hit count – none of these measures applied. There were too few users for reliable A/B testing. So, to track success – or otherwise – I needed a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I relied on benchmarking. That means establishing a base level (a ‘benchmark’) and making an evaluation by comparing results to that benchmark. It’s how we judge whether sign-up rates, amount spent etc, have gone up or down, but for this project – in the absence of those measures – I used user satisfaction ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to plan ahead. Before the project began (Feb 2015), I sent a survey to users, our business partners. A number of questions helped to formulate my UX review (to do with tasks, usage, etc), while others focused purely on benchmarking. I provided a number of statements (for example, ‘I can complete my tasks efficiently’, ‘It is easy to use Insight’) and asked users how much they agreed, from 1 to 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Asking these questions couldn’t give me the evidence I needed to formulate solutions – for that, I undertook a number of usability tests with partners.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 months later, we launched a new version of the portal (Insight), which the development team had significantly overhauled based on my recommendations. 3 months after that, when users had got used to the new system, I sent a follow-up survey with the same benchmarking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;benchmarking-results&quot;&gt;Benchmarking results &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#benchmarking-results&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/UX-benchmarking-results-table-with-header.png&quot; alt=&quot;UX benchmarking results table &quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;UX benchmarking results table, showing weighted averages for each survey out of 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average increase was 25.7%. Agreement with the key statement “Overall, I am satisfied with Insight”, increased 32.5%. In a number of cases the level of agreement increased by over 30%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is still room for improvement, the percentage increases are significant. They very much indicate a successful project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a hugely importance exercise, because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It proved the effectiveness and importance of UX (particularly significant when you consider that I am the first UX specialist employed by Kings Court Trust and this was my first project)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Kings Court Trust, it provided an indication of return-on-investment, with success justifying the cost and development resource&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It provided quantitative evidence, as opposed to qualitative word-of-mouth feedback, that the users – our business partners – appreciated the changes, an important aspect of our commercial relationship with them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will help to guide and justify future UX work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It identifies areas for further improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It motivates the team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I made a big deal of these results within the company. And it was not just about me; our developers worked overtime to implement the changes, and a number of others were involved from marketing to project management. It was a fantastic team success, and these results vindicate our effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it’s worth noting that we did not decide in advance what constitutes success. Would it have been a successful project if mean satisfaction rates went up by 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%…? This can be difficult, but it’s a useful step that we’ve begun to implement on more recent projects. Though for this project, I don’t think we lost out by not doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design and UX have subjective elements, and this can cloud the need for objective measurements. Often, it simply doesn’t happen. But in my view, objectively measuring the success of UX work, in whatever way works for a particular project, is a critical part of the process. It justifies our work, proves our worth to employers and clients, and provides valuable metrics which can guide future projects. After all, we’re in the results business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means planning ahead and considering how the success of the project will be measured even before it begins.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/poor-error-prevention-stressful-evening-thanks-a-lot-apple/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/posts/household-heuristics-why-a-flashing-light-is-good-ux/&quot;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt; I touched on Nielsen’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/&quot;&gt;10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design&lt;/a&gt;“. Though 20 years old, these nuggets still ring true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a biggie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error prevention&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s more good stuff about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/&quot;&gt;errors and how to prevent them&lt;/a&gt; on the NNG site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently fell foul of what I consider to be an inexcusable lack of error prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Apple’s native Mail application on my Macbook, I searched for the out-of-office feature. It doesn’t exist (pity). Apparently I needed to set up a rule, to send a friendly message in reply to any incoming email, letting the sender know I’ll be sunning myself in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All good so far, and one final action for me to take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Mac-Mail.png&quot; alt=&quot;The offending window in MacMail - poor error prevention&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The offending window in MacMail – poor error prevention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I was in a bit of a hurry to log off and go on holiday, but of course the choice was obvious – I clicked the welcoming blue button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two minutes later I got a call from my line manager, who was heading home on the train. His phone was going BING, BING, BING, BING, BING, BING, BING, BING, BING, BING – attracting the attention of other commuters, until he switched it to silent, but the emails had kept flooding in. 300 of them or so. (My only saving grace is that I’d only joined the company a couple of months previously, so the number of emails were limited.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I retraced my steps and realised that that enticing blue button had applied my rule to ALL emails in my inbox, which meant a reply had been sent to EVERY email I’d EVER received letting my colleagues (including the CEO and various others) know I’d be on holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3794748?start=15&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6053279?start=0&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4209073?start=0&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4038511?start=0&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;person&lt;/a&gt; this has happened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple die-hards may dismiss this as user error, and sure – I make mistakes like anyone now and again – but I maintain that this hugely embarrassing, unexpected consequence of such a common, ostensibly simple task was far too easily done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1.-mail-should-have-an-out-of-office-feature.&quot;&gt;1. Mail should have an out-of-office feature. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#1.-mail-should-have-an-out-of-office-feature.&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debacle prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2.-why%2C-why%2C-why-would-i-ever-want-the-actions-i-took-to-lead-to-the-results-that-occurred%3F&quot;&gt;2. Why, why, why would I ever want the actions I took to lead to the results that occurred? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#2.-why%2C-why%2C-why-would-i-ever-want-the-actions-i-took-to-lead-to-the-results-that-occurred%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot envisage a single reasonable scenario where any user would want to send the same reply to every single old email in their inbox. It simply shouldn’t have been possible for this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3.-it-shouldn%E2%80%99t-have-been-so-easy.&quot;&gt;3. It shouldn’t have been so easy. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#3.-it-shouldn%E2%80%99t-have-been-so-easy.&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it had to be possible (which it didn’t), it was far too easy for me to click that button, considering the seriousness of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of research about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/&quot;&gt;how little people read online&lt;/a&gt;, and the impact and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paulolyslager.com/call-to-action-buttons-psychology-color/&quot;&gt;psychology of colours&lt;/a&gt;. So, 100% scientifically, this is what my brain processed when I saw that confirmation window:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Mac-Mail-blurred-JPEG.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;UX - how the brain processes colours and text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientifically, what my brain processed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting aside the issue that this result shouldn’t have been possible in the first place, there are options which might reduce the likelihood of errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;swapping the buttons, to make ‘Don’t Apply’ the default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;showing ‘Apply’ as text (rather than a button) to further distinguish it from the preferred option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding a warning symbol and/or warning explanation to ‘Apply’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rewording the window to make the action and consequences clear (the copy at the moment is very unclear, in my view) and changing the wording on the ‘Apply’ button to something more specific like ‘Reply to every single email in your inbox, even though you’d never ever want to do so’ (er… or maybe something a little more concise)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A confirmation ‘Are you sure?’ pop-up, or the option to undo before the changes kick in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4.-users-hate-errors&quot;&gt;4. Users hate errors &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#4.-users-hate-errors&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When poor system design leads to serious consequences for the user that could and should have been avoided, that’s about as frustrating as it gets in terms of user experience. Error prevention isn’t the most glamorous part of UX but there’s nothing more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve stopped using Mac Mail.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Design for print – achieving the best colours and blacks</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/design-for-print-achieving-the-best-colours-and-blacks/"/>
		<updated>2016-08-03T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/design-for-print-achieving-the-best-colours-and-blacks/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I digress from the usual topic of UX to share some lessons from my recent foray into design for print, which was challenging, rewarding and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was given the challenge of taking an agency’s creative vision and using it as the basis for designing Kings Court Trust’s printed materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing for print is not something I had done to this scale before. I knew enough to know that there was much I didn’t know; particularly, about getting the best colours on paper – one of the most important, and bewildering, parts of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone dipping a toe into the the world of print, here are the lessons I wish I knew before I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1.-rgb-vs-cmyk&quot;&gt;1. RGB vs CMYK &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#1.-rgb-vs-cmyk&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RGB and CMYK are two colour models; effectively, two different ways of displaying colours. A bit like paint ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most professional printing presses are based on CMYK. So, if you haven’t got your head around colour models well before the first print run arrives on your desk, you could be in for a nasty surprise – regardless of how stunning it looked on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video is an excellent introduction to CMYK and RGB:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6gOVHTwJ2mQ&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s some of the nitty gritty, much of it specific to the latest Adobe CC suite (apologies if you don’t use it):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Screen-Shot-2016-06-30-at-21.29.18.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adobe swatches showing RGB and CMYK differences&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find it helps to create a swatch library with both RGB and CMYK colours, &lt;a href=&quot;https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/choosing-colors.html&quot;&gt;using the Adobe CC colour picker&lt;/a&gt;. Above is a screenshot of my swatches: the differences between RGB and CMYK variations are particularly marked in the oranges and greens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determining the right colours in the first place is more difficult. If you use a designer, ask for CMYK, RGB and hex equivalents for every colour. In our case, we had tremendous difficulty translating our green from RGB to CMYK… turns out green in particular is a pain in the arse when it comes to CMYK. But after experimenting and having a few test runs, we got the right one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In InDesign (or equivalent), make sure the ‘transparency blend space’ is RGB or CMYK as appropriate – the wrong one can produce some odd results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t bother converting RGB imagery to CMYK (or vice versa) before importing – this is a myth. If your export settings are set up properly, this will do the conversion for you. (Though it’s not so simple for text…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an RGB version of the document for downloading, emailing and printing at home/office – on screen, these colours tend to look more vibrant than CMYK. Create a CMYK version with all the trimmings (bleed, printer marks etc) for professional printing, though check with your printer first for the best settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to check if a file is CMYK or RGB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be helpful to do a final check of a file before it’s sent to print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re lucky enough to have the very handy Adobe Acrobat Pro DC and you want to check a file’s colour model, open ‘Tools’, ‘Print production’, then ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/previewing-output-acrobat-pro.html&quot;&gt;Output preview&lt;/a&gt;‘. Under ‘Show’, select ‘CMYK’ – if all the elements on the page (apart from printer marks) remain visible, it’s CMYK. Then select ‘RGB’ – if it’s CMYK, all elements will disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Screen-Shot-2016-06-30-at-22.11.27.png&quot; alt=&quot;Acrobat Pro output preview showing CMYK&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above – the output preview in Acrobat showing anything CMYK. The page elements remain visible so they must be CMYK.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in ‘Output preview’, if you select ‘Preview’ &amp;gt; ‘Separations’, you can hover the cursor over an element on the page to see a breakdown of the CMYK values. Particularly helpful to check for four-colour blacks (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Screen-Shot-2016-06-30-at-22.09.57.png&quot; alt=&quot;Acrobat Pro output preview showing CMYK colour breakdown&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above – hovering the cursor (not shown) over a colour in output preview will show the four CMYK values&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2.-black%E2%80%99s-not-necessarily-black&quot;&gt;2. Black’s not necessarily black &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#2.-black%E2%80%99s-not-necessarily-black&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that looks black on screen might not appear black in print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve blacker blacks and greyer greys, conventional wisdom is to avoid “four colour blacks”. That’s a black or grey made up of four CMYK values, e.g. C75 M67 Y67 K89. Instead, it’s often best to ensure blacks have a “K” value alone – e.g. C0 M0 Y0 K100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up the right swatches in your software is a great start. I use C0 M0 Y0 K12 for a light grey, C0 M0 Y0 K30 for a mid grey and C0 M0 Y0 K50 for a slightly darker grey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Indesign, under ‘Preferences’ and ‘Appearance of blacks’, make sure ‘Printing / Exporting’ is set to &lt;a href=&quot;http://indesignsecrets.com/preventing-4-color-blacks-in-pdfs.php&quot;&gt;‘Output all blacks accurately’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the right export settings (below) is also crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to identify four-colour and one-colour blacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s often helpful to check the blacks in a file after export. Using Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, under tools, choose ‘Print production’ and then ‘Output preview’. Select a CMYK profile from ‘Simulation profile’, e.g. Coated FOGRA39. In the preview section, select ‘Separations’. If you untick ‘Process Black’, all one-colour blacks will be removed, and all four-colour blacks will remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Screen-Shot-2016-06-30-at-22.16.30.png&quot; alt=&quot;Acrobat Pro output preview separations&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Above – Acrobat Pro output preview showing all four parts of CMYK, so every element on the page is visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Screen-Shot-2016-06-30-at-22.16.39.png&quot; alt=&quot;Acrobat Pro output preview separations&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Above – ‘Process Black’ has been unticked, so all genuine one colour blacks disappear (only elements made up of cyan, magenta and yellow remain, like the orange headings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Screen-Shot-2016-06-30-at-22.16.52.png&quot; alt=&quot;Acrobat Pro output preview separations&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Above – Oops… on this page, some cheeky grey lines remain, which means they can’t be one-colour. This needs fixing, so it’s back to the original document to sort it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3.-the-right-software%2C-the-right-export-settings&quot;&gt;3. The right software, the right export settings &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#3.-the-right-software%2C-the-right-export-settings&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For brochures and other documents, I use Adobe Indesign CC. In terms of colours, ‘Output’ is an important part of the ‘Export’ settings. To ensure a document exports as CMYK: for ‘Color conversion’ select ‘Convert to destination’; for destination I use ‘Document CMYK’ (which takes the current working space from the document settings, which for me is ‘Coated FOGRA39 (ISO 12646-2:2004)’); for ‘Profile inclusion policy’ I use ‘Don’t include profiles’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Screen-Shot-2016-06-30-at-22.30.20.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adobe export settings&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4.-find-a-friendly-printer&quot;&gt;4. Find a friendly printer &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#4.-find-a-friendly-printer&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good relationship with your print professional helps enormously – they can identify problems and suggest solutions before the print run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the tip of the iceberg. There’s paper stock, finish, bleed, trim, slug, litho vs digital (for more information on litho vs digital, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW1HJdW5XLs&quot;&gt;check out this video and others from the same channel&lt;/a&gt;), etc etc. But achieving the right colours and blacks is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The worst error message in the airport</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/the-worst-error-message-in-the-airport/"/>
		<updated>2017-01-12T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/the-worst-error-message-in-the-airport/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to errors, error prevention – through great UX and well-built code – is first and foremost. There’s a lot more to say about error prevention (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2015/11/error-messages-are-an-anti-pattern.php&quot;&gt;this blogger has some wise thoughts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/poor-error-prevention-stressful-evening-thanks-a-lot-apple/&quot;&gt;I blogged about it a while ago&lt;/a&gt;), but this post is about when errors do happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user makes an error – for example, typing the wrong password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a bug or issue with the software or service – for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-story-behind-twitters-fail-whale/384313/&quot;&gt;the famous Twitter fail whale&lt;/a&gt; when the service was overloaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google material design guidelines has some &lt;a href=&quot;https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/errors.html#&quot;&gt;useful insight into error types&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nielsen’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/error-message-guidelines/&quot;&gt;well-established error message guidelines&lt;/a&gt; suggest error messages should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be explicit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be human-readable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be polite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be precise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offer constructive advice on how to proceed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase, an error message should tell a user clearly what the f**k is going on and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, take the following display, snapped on my phone in Manchester Airport’s departure lounge before Christmas, an hour or so before our flight was cancelled (poor us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Airport-error-message-smaller.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Airport error message UX&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message, in the centre of a blank display which should have shown flight departure times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is useless to its intended audience (ordinary human beings), as it is filled with techno-babble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is literally unreadable in places&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provides no guidance on how to fix the error and restore the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;may have been marginally clearer if its button read ‘Terminate program’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;includes a close icon, whose purpose is unclear (does it close the message or terminate the program?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No error message in the context of a departure lounge display board is a good error message – all passengers want to do is see departure times, and can do nothing to fix the error. It’s a prime example of where error prevention is far more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, error messages like this persist in other contexts – we’ve probably all seen them many times. There’s no excuse – error messages should simply be simply and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I would add something to the Nielsen list: ‘design for the worst’. Sure, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/funny-creative-error-404/&quot;&gt;‘hilarious’ 404 messages&lt;/a&gt; – when the user hits a page that no longer exists – can be fun. But not everyone is in the mood to be entertained. Even the friendly mailing service Mailchimp &lt;a href=&quot;http://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone/&quot;&gt;acknowledges in its tone of voice guidance&lt;/a&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they relieved to be finished with a campaign? Are they confused and seeking our help on Twitter? Are they curious about a post on our blog? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So does Mailchimp’s current 404 error message breach its own rules? You decide…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-21.41.48.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mailchimp 404 error message&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green swamp-monster not withstanding, Mailchimp’s error message is readable, concise and offers a clear next step (the navigation or search box) – unlike the message in the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>UX and the death of It Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many businesses suffer from the ‘it seemed like a good idea at the time’ syndrome, where software or features are built on the suggestion of an individual or two. Time and money is spent on implementation, but often the results go by the wayside: never finished for lack of clarity of vision; never used for lack of user interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UX methodology avoids ‘ISLAGIATT’ projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with the tenet that a business doesn’t necessarily know what its users want. But more than that: users don’t necessarily want what they ask for. That’s not as counter-intuitive as it might seem: though UX is firmly rooted in user evidence, that’s not synonymous with what they say they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite example of this is an experiment run by Petter Johansson, a cognitive science researcher at Lund University. &lt;a href=&quot;https://explorable.com/choice-blindness&quot;&gt;As explained by Petter and his colleague Lars Hall&lt;/a&gt;, two cards of same-gender faces were placed in front of participants. They were asked which face they found more attractive. Unbeknownst to participants, the moderator was a magician who, with slight of hand, presented the participants with the face they rejected. They were then asked to explain their choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/Choice-blindness-face-card-experiment.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Choice blindness face card experiment&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The choice blindness experiment is a useful lesson for UX practitioners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;75% of the time, participants were blind to the mismatch. Furthermore, the majority proceeded to give detailed reasons why they choose that face over the other, one remarking “I prefer blondes” (he’d chosen a brunette). Johansson calls this ‘choice blindness’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give another example, perhaps I’m designing the information architecture for a clothing e-commerce site. I present someone with a random list of all clothing categories and I ask them to find ‘shoes’. Understandably, they say – ‘I wish these were in alphabetical order’. However, that doesn’t mean that laying out categories alphabetically is the best approach for the website. What if a visitor wants to find a suitable gift for Christmas, or something cool for summer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding that users don’t necessarily ask for precisely what they want is a small piece in the long and broad road to great UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a process and methodology that gives companies the tools they need to build better software – stuff that users actually want, that will drive businesses forward. It makes sure projects develop in line with user needs, that solve real problems, that tie in with business requirements, and that test assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the UX method kills ‘ISLAGIATT’.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Why giving users a choice in UX research can be a bad idea</title>

		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/why-giving-users-a-choice-in-ux-research-can-be-a-bad-idea/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/posts/ux-and-the-death-of-it-seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-time/&quot;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about “choice blindness”, the principle, supported by research, that people can be blind to their own choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In designing solutions through user research, presenting users with multiple variations of a feature, and asking them to choose their favourite, tends to be unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In UX, an iterative approach is thought to be better. Start with a proposition based on evidence from users (or a proposal for testing from the business), build something testable (a paper prototype, wireframe, etc), and trial it through usability testing with real users, in context. Identify the aspects that work, remove or change those that don’t. Iterate, and test again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching users use a system and making iterations based on observation and evidence tends to yield best results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenting users with choices is often the wrong way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ever, it’s the Simpsons that puts it best…&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Digitising death 1/2 – solving problems for bereaved families</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/digitising-death-1-2-solving-problems-for-bereaved-families/"/>
		<updated>2018-11-10T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/digitising-death-1-2-solving-problems-for-bereaved-families/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a death, bank accounts must be closed or transferred, utilities cancelled and assets sold. The practicalities of bereavement have changed little in 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those past 100 years have seen staggering change for consumers (living ones) in terms of how we can access money, handle transactions, confirm our identity and enter into agreements. Thanks to Open Banking, I can download an app which allows me to manage my accounts across multiple banks. I can open an account and pay in a cheque with a couple of photos. I can complete transactions and apply for loans online. I can renew my passport, insure my car and pay tax digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has probate been similarly revolutionised? Sadly not. The infrastructure of death in the UK is relatively unchanged. Once a consumer dies, their relatives lose the digital opportunities available to the living and are faced with a lengthy, paper-based, manual process, with banks operating in silos (meaning lots of duplicated effort).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This often means: paying for multiple paper copies of a death certificate and sending them off by post; filling in a different form for every bank by hand; visiting a local bank branch and bringing paper ID; passing through metal detectors in a court building to swear an oath; multiple phone calls to chase things up; a total lack of visibility of progress; almost nothing available digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Change is like a glacier”, as someone from the probate service once said to me. But change is surely on the horizon, because innovation happens when there are clear problems to be solved, the technology to solve them and the commercial opportunity — and I’m certain there are all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The problem&lt;/em&gt; is that for relatives and their representatives (solicitors etc), the manual, paper-based process is stressful, difficult, time-consuming and inefficient. The lack of visibility and efficiency causes frustration for families at a time of heightened sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The technology&lt;/em&gt; includes electronic registration of death, Open Banking, APIs and digital ID / fraud solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The commercial opportunity&lt;/em&gt; is that over half a million people die in the UK every year, with billions of pounds inherited annually. But for banks, the paper trail, manual processes, call-handling and siloed approaches results in every death costing them money, poor customer service and lost opportunities for customer retention. This is much a problem for the financial sector as it is for families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;glimmers-of-change&quot;&gt;Glimmers of change &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#glimmers-of-change&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen small changes. By May 2018, 2,871 applications for grant had been made online via HM Courts &amp;amp; Tribunal Service’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/wills-probate-inheritance/applying-for-a-grant-of-representation&quot;&gt;digital grant application service&lt;/a&gt;. This service isn’t yet available to everyone (for example, it’s not an option if there’s no will), and paper documents like the will and death certificate still have to be sent by post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2018, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deathnotificationservice.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Death Notification Service&lt;/a&gt; launched. The British Bankers’ Association asked share registrars Equiniti to set it up, and the big banks pay Equiniti to run it. It’s a way for relatives to inform multiple banks of a death in one go – a sort of ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once&quot;&gt;Tell Us Once&lt;/a&gt;’ for the private sector. The relative fills out a form online, digital checks are made, data is sent sent to the member institutions, and each makes a search for the deceased’s accounts (some manually, some with a degree of automation.) Then, it’s over to each bank to run their own bereavement processes – that means, as usual, their own closure form, families sending documents by post, a different threshold for the grant of representation depending on banking group, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNS is therefore the small tip of a big iceberg. Its closed approach is a disappointment – it’s not overtly a system upon which third parties can build services via APIs (contrast the infrastructure of Open Banking, which openly encourages integration and innovation). That said, Equiniti appears genuinely keen to engage with third parties, so perhaps there are opportunities. And I’m not a fan of its UI. Nevertheless, small steps in a glacial industry deserve applause – they take effort, commitment and collaboration. The DNS is a positive step and a vital opening of a door – it’s proof that banks are thinking about the problems of bereavement and are willing to work together to start solving them, without having to be forced by government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stifling-innovation-and-customer-experience&quot;&gt;Stifling innovation and customer experience &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#stifling-innovation-and-customer-experience&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probate industry is fragmented. 9 out of 10 providers are high street solicitors. There are a handful of providers trying to break the mould for the better for families, but everyone is working on top of the same outdated architecture. It’s hard to innovate digitally when paper documents have to be shuffled about by post, or to disrupt when constantly butting up against an antiquated infrastructure. The most common complaints against probate specialists are delays and communication, but this is in part the fault of the systems underpinning death in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is bad for bereaved families. They deserve innovation, design thinking and a disrupted marketplace – there lies the solutions to problems and significant commercial opportunities. This can only happen on a suitable scale if there’s a concerted effort to modernise the way death is handled in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;vulnerable-users&quot;&gt;Vulnerable users &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#vulnerable-users&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems dealing with a deceased person’s assets are mirrored in other areas. Attorneys acting a lasting power of attorney face similarly lengthy, paper-based processes, often causing delays, stress and financial difficulty at a hugely sensitive time. Digital solutions for these vulnerable customers are intertwined with those for personal representatives of a deceased.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Digitising death 2/2 – how innovation can bring change for the better</title>

		<updated>2018-11-10T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/digitising-death-2-2-how-innovation-can-bring-change-for-the-better/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Part 1 I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/posts/digitising-death-1-2-solving-problems-for-bereaved-families/&quot;&gt;problems faced by the sector and recent signs of hope&lt;/a&gt;. Part 2 covers the hurdles to overcome, and how innovation can bring change for the better for families and the probate industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;taking-a-photo-of-the-death-certificate&quot;&gt;Taking a photo of the death certificate &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#taking-a-photo-of-the-death-certificate&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can open a bank account by taking photos of my passport and my face. I can pay in a cheque with a photo. A relatively simple step forward would be for banks, registrars and utility companies to accept a photo of a death certificate, taken by phone. It would save relatives the cost and hassle of sending this paper document by post, and save institutions the cost of administering the paper trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;instant-access-to-digital-death-records&quot;&gt;Instant access to digital death records &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#instant-access-to-digital-death-records&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a photo is an interim solution. A better one is an open, up-to-date digital death registry. This would remove the need for a paper certificate by allowing deaths to be confirmed digitally, immediately after registration. There is already a semblance of this, albeit one that’s limited and tightly controlled. For recent deaths, confirmation is held in a dataset under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disclosure-of-death-registration-information-how-to-apply/disclosure-of-death-registration-information&quot;&gt;disclosure of death registration information (DDRI) scheme&lt;/a&gt;. It’s governed by primary legislation, administered by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gro.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GRO&lt;/a&gt; and available only to a select number of organisations satisfying strict criteria such as Experian, CallCredit and Equifax. They in turn work with organisations such as the Death Notification Service. The info is sent round once week, around 7-14 days after a death (so it’s never entirely up to date). As a member of the public, I can’t access this information – to confirm a death digitally, I’d have to wait 6 months for it to appear on the GRO website. Which is why thousands of paper death certificates are still pushed around the postal system every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question is whether families, lawyers, credit reference agencies and the financial sector would be much better served by registrations of deaths being recorded instantly on a central death register, accessible to the public and via API. Death’s generally a matter of public record, after all. With a more accessible system, there’d be no (or very limited) need for paper death certificates. Banks, utility companies, credit reference agencies and so on could confirm deaths electronically, instantly. No more time and cost wasted by relatives, solicitors and asset-holders sending / receiving / administering paper certificates. A platform for innovation and a step up in the fight against fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to confirm death digitally is a significant blocker to innovation in the bereavement sector. Changing it requires government support. Let’s send choccies to the design-focused, problem-busting people at &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GDS&lt;/a&gt; and see if they can move the cogs of the machine from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;collaboration-and-standardised-bereavement-protocols-in-the-finance-sector-and-beyond&quot;&gt;Collaboration and standardised bereavement protocols in the finance sector and beyond &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#collaboration-and-standardised-bereavement-protocols-in-the-finance-sector-and-beyond&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every banking group has its own deceased account-holder closure / transfer form. But every form is essentially the same. It’s a generic data set — details of the deceased, the family, the accounts, and where they should send the money. On the face of it, there are no commercial reasons why banks, utility companies and others couldn’t accept one set of generic instructions from personal representatives, submitted electronically. Standardisation offers efficiencies and cost-savings for banks and a simpler, faster process for families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joined up thinking could also help to standardise grant thresholds across the sector. It’s an oddity that HSBC require the grant on a case-by-case basis, Natwest at £25k, Santander at £50k etc. If there were ways to share information digitally between families and institutions, the banks could, for example, set a threshold of £100k between them, regardless of how much there is in each bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-banking-for-the-dead%3F&quot;&gt;Open Banking for the dead? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#open-banking-for-the-dead%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Banking is the way the UK put in place a piece of European legislation called the Payment Service Directive (PSD2). It’s a big deal for consumers – it opens up banks’ data and allows third parties to build innovative solutions for people’s banking problems. It came online in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Banking is very much for the living. I’ve found no reference in any primary source about implementation after death. The idea of Open Banking for deceased account-holders has been barely discussed publicly (I’ve only ever found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.co-operative.coop/media/news-releases/comment-on-open-banking-from-gavin-holt-head-of-legal-practice-probate-at&quot;&gt;one brief blog post on the subject&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the possibilities are huge. Families and their lawyers could see the deceased’s account balances and transactions online. Figures for tax could be calculated instantly and winding up outgoings made simple. Funds could be transferred electronically, financial summaries created automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are technical hurdles to using Open Banking for the dead. For example, the central concept of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) – it’s how an account owner proves their identity and provides authentication by way of a secure key, password, text message, memorable information, etc. This can’t be done, of course, by a deceased account-holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Open Banking post death is not inconceivable. But if it’s just too far out of scope, at least it has opened minds and sparked innovative thinking within banks. They’re increasingly keen to bring in entrepreneurial people and work with / learn from startups. This encouraging trend will hopefully filter through to the bereavement space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Banking is at its simplest a set of protocols and APIs. Banks and third parties could work together to produce something similar for probate, whether under the Open Banking banner or not. The question will be whether they do so without being forced by government (as they were with PSD2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;killing-off-the-grant&quot;&gt;Killing off the grant &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#killing-off-the-grant&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grant of representation (aka grant of probate) was introduced in more or less its current form in 1858, with the establishment of the Principle Probate Registry. ‘Getting probate’ is an essential part of the process for higher value estates: property can’t be sold without a grant; banks need to see a grant before they’ll close high value accounts; Equiniti need one for shareholdings over £10k; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grant is a product of the courts. As such, personal representatives typically have to swear an oath, often at a probate registry (essentially, a court), complete with metal detectors and security guards. It takes weeks to arrive (by post, naturally), and then has to to be sent off to asset-holders. In today’s world where we can marry, take out a mortgage and open a bank account with more or less just a couple of signatures, the grant is a peculiar anachronism (can you imagine swearing an oath to get a mortgage?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, better options are conceivable. All that’s achieved with the grant could theoretically be achieved digitally, securely and instantly (more or less). For example, Experian, Equifax and the like provide digital identity checks and fraud prevention; the government has its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify&quot;&gt;Verify&lt;/a&gt; service. The process could be faster, easier and more visible for families, cheaper and more efficient for asset-holders, and as good or better for fraud prevention. As grants are public documents, there’s no legal reason why the information couldn’t be publicly accessible via an API. So, rather than swearing an oath and waiting weeks, it could all be done in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks aren’t legally obliged to require a grant (I believe), but the grant persists because it’s well established and there’s currently no viable alternative. It’s the safe option. It’s also muddled up with the way inheritance tax is paid, legal processes like caveats, and a handful of other reasons which mean that removing or modernising the grant is a complicated proposition. It would require a concerted effort from the British Bankers’ Association and others, and perhaps collaboration with government, which unfortunately has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/21/government-drops-plan-to-raise-probate-fees&quot;&gt;seen it as a way to make money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernising or replacing the grant won’t happen tomorrow. But the days of this Victorian piece of paper in its current form are surely numbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;achieving-change&quot;&gt;Achieving change &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#achieving-change&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Openness, collaboration, innovation and design thinking are key to achieving change in the bereavement sector, and doing it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While probate is traditionally seen as belonging to the legal space, solutions may largely be driven by finance. (After all, probate, really, is about sorting out assets, debts and tax.) But whether it’s LawTech or FinTech, who cares? It’s problem-solving tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Banking shows the way – an API-based infrastructure giving startups and others the freedom to solve consumer problems. APIs should play an important part in bereavement – things will really be motoring when a death is confirmed, ID / fraud checks take place, banks are informed and accounts are closed digitally, securely, accurately and quickly through APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closed, proprietary solutions stifle innovation, which is bad for consumers. Industry and government need to think openly. How about an ‘Open Bereavement’ protocol to bring the Open Banking model to the death space?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation in the bereavement sector is gradually becoming a talking point. #deathtech is kind of a thing. But considering half a million people die in the UK every year, it remains drastically under-discussed. I hope conversations increase, and happen in the open. Openness by default engenders trust and collaboration, which is good for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some solicitors will resist moves to digital because they charge by the letter. They’re not focused on solving their clients’ problems, so they’ll be left behind. Other solicitors and probate providers, along with banks, building societies, utilities, share registrars and, most of all, families, want to see these problems solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m no economist, but I suspect the nation’s finances would be healthier without a mountain of paper-based inefficiency at the heart of a £1 billion+ industry. No doubt modernisation fits with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard&quot;&gt;government’s drive towards digital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully conversations and innovations will ramp up, now that Open Banking, online grants and the Death Notification Service have opened minds and pushed the digitising death door very slightly ajar.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2019-10-19T01:00:00+01:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/weeknotes-1-14-20-oct-2019/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having been inspired by the likes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.victorhwang.co/weeknotes/2019/06/12/week2.html&quot;&gt;Victor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/dans-weeknotes-s05e06-44c970484e59&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/@jukesie&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;, here’s my first attempt at weeknotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday was Big Train Experiment Day. For the last 11 months I’d been waking up at 5:30am for a 7am train from York (where I live) to London (where I work), every Monday. I’d been sleeping on the train – or trying to – and often felt like I was playing catchup for the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so this Monday: my alarm went off at 6:45; I had a coffee; caught the bus; grabbed the 8:20 train. The difference was huge. I felt awake, productive and alive with the joys of life. I arrived in the office later (10:45am), but worked more hours overall and felt less tired. Experiment: successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;welcoming-our-first-user-researcher&quot;&gt;Welcoming our first user researcher &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#welcoming-our-first-user-researcher&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on Monday I had only my second 1:1 with our new user researcher, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/clareridd?lang=en&quot;&gt;Clare Ridd&lt;/a&gt;. She’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://farewill.com/&quot;&gt;Farewill’s&lt;/a&gt; first dedicated researcher, and it’s already abundantly clear how fantastic it will be to have her around. Clare’s my first direct report, i.e. the first person I’ve managed. It’s one of my career regrets that I haven’t had the opportunity to be a line manager until now. Supporting others and helping them be the best they can be is something I’m hugely excited about. One thing I’ve been doing to prepare is reading Julie Zhuo’s excellent Making of a Manager book, which I highly recommend. I’m sure I’ll make plenty of mistakes (and I hope Clare will tell me when I do) but I’m enjoying it so far, and Clare seems to be settling in brilliantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;all-hands-wobble&quot;&gt;All Hands wobble &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#all-hands-wobble&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was an odd one. We had our weekly All Hands at 10:30 – where we all gather round in the office (or dial in, if remote) and run through company performance and news from different teams. I gave up an update for the Probate Product team, something I’d done many times before. This time, I was hit by a wave of minor panic – I felt vulnerable and self-conscious, and I could hear my voice wavering. Sometimes I can be relaxed and confident when speaking in front of others; other times not. It could simply be that the Farewill team is growing fast – now, an All Hands update means speaking in front of 40 people. Whatever the cause, this wobble has been on my mind for the last few days (without any helpful conclusions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-joy-of-illustrations&quot;&gt;The joy of illustrations &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-joy-of-illustrations&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farewill is rebranding and &lt;a href=&quot;https://probate.farewill.com/&quot;&gt;our probate website&lt;/a&gt; was updated this week. It’s been such a pleasure to work on. As always, I’ve tried to run things as collaboratively and openly, and we’ve had fantastic input from lots of the wider Farewill team. Not least from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/missycharity?lang=en-gb&quot;&gt;Anna Charity&lt;/a&gt; and Louis Buck who provided incredible illustrations which convey tricky concepts simply and visually. The illustration at the top of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://probate.farewill.com/help/what-is-probate&quot;&gt;‘What is probate?’ page&lt;/a&gt; is wonderful (if you follow the link on mobile you might not see it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/probate-website-design-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Farewill probate website screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also in love with the brush strokes between sections on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://probate.farewill.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; (on larger screens), crafted by Emily Isacke. It’s the sort of detail that is easy not to bother with, but these things make a difference. Although it is &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a designery thing to hone in on (sorry…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/probate-website-design-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Farewill probate website screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-importance-of-a-name&quot;&gt;The importance of a name &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-importance-of-a-name&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this week I’ve been working on our blossoming internal sales and customer tool. As of yet it doesn’t have a name. Hardly the most important point you might think, but the lack of identity is beginning to cause confusion. It’s been variously described as our ‘call tool’, ‘ICT’ (Initial Call Tool / Internal Call Tool), ‘admin tool’, ‘customer admin tool’ and probably a dozen other things. That was fine for a while, but it needs clarifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I sent round a survey for ideas. Some of the more questionable responses so far include Data Entry and Administration Database (it’s all about the acronym), Winternal Tool and Dan. The search continues…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow (Sunday) I run the Yorkshire Marathon, my first ever marathon. Training has been a huge part of my year so far and it’s a peculiar thought that it’s in less than 24 hours. I’m excited and nervous – my longer training runs (about 34km) were incredibly hard, and I know the marathon (42km) will be even harder. Beyond that I don’t know what to expect, but whatever happens I’m glad I committed to it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>I rebuilt my website the hard way</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/i-rebuilt-my-website-the-hard-way/"/>
		<updated>2019-12-30T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/i-rebuilt-my-website-the-hard-way/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been painfully aware for some time that some of my technical knowledge is lacking. Things like how to build a website (without using Wordpress). That sort of thing is on the outer edges of my role as a designer, but I reckon if I know more about it it would help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the last month or two I&#39;ve found the time to work on it. Here&#39;s what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1---come-up-with-a-project&quot;&gt;1 - Come up with a project &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#1---come-up-with-a-project&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to focus my efforts on rebuilding my personal website, is a very modest affair with just a few pages and even fewer visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2---learn-about-css-grids&quot;&gt;2 - Learn about CSS grids &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#2---learn-about-css-grids&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m comfortable enough with CSS but my knowledge is 10 years old. I&#39;d never used &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout&quot;&gt;CSS grids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I learned about them with things like the fun &lt;a href=&quot;https://cssgridgarden.com/&quot;&gt;CSS Grid Garden&lt;/a&gt;. And I messed around with them using Glitch (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gaudy-apostosaurus.glitch.me/blog.html&quot;&gt;here&#39;s my test site&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glitch was so easy and fun - it seems like such a great way to try things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3---get-visual-studio-code-to-build-a-static-site&quot;&gt;3 - Get Visual Studio Code to build a static site &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#3---get-visual-studio-code-to-build-a-static-site&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was time to delve into the murky (for me) world of code editors and Terminal. So I got Visual Studio Code, which everyone seems to be using (I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not true).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4---install-jekyll-and-run-through-the-tutorial&quot;&gt;4 - Install Jekyll and run through the tutorial &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#4---install-jekyll-and-run-through-the-tutorial&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5---install-eleventy-and-get-the-base-blog&quot;&gt;5 - Install Eleventy and get the base blog &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#5---install-eleventy-and-get-the-base-blog&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/charlotte_dann?lang=en&quot;&gt;Charlotte Dann&lt;/a&gt; that Eleventy is the static site generator that the cool kids are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6---tweak%2C-tweak%2C-tweak-and-deploy&quot;&gt;6 - Tweak, tweak, tweak and deploy &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#6---tweak%2C-tweak%2C-tweak-and-deploy&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;7 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#7&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

		<title>Deploying Eleventy to GitHub Pages - one way of doing it</title>
		<link href="https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/deploying-eleventy-to-github-pages-one-way/"/>
		<updated>2019-12-31T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/posts/deploying-eleventy-to-github-pages-one-way/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I used Eleventy to rebuild my personal website, and had a bit a headache getting it deployed to GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s not much guidance online. Jonathan Snook has written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://snook.ca/archives/servers/deploying-11ty-to-gh-pages&quot;&gt;deploying an 11ty site to GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; - but it felt a little daunting to me so I thought I&#39;d try and cobble together a different approach that doesn&#39;t involve using Travis CI for the build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m very new to all of this so I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s best, but here&#39;s how I ended up doing it - hopefully it&#39;s helpful for anyone hoping to use Eleventy and GitHub pages. I&#39;d be interested to know if I could have done it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1---build-locally-and-get-everything-on-github&quot;&gt;1 - Build locally and get everything on GitHub &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#1---build-locally-and-get-everything-on-github&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Jonathan Snook&#39;s method, I built the site locally and published it to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, Eleventy won&#39;t publish the local build to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I found .gitignore and removed this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;_site/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means the content of the local site (in the _site folder) gets pushed to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2---set-up-github-pages-and-set-the-build-directory-to-%2Fdocs%2F&quot;&gt;2 - Set up GitHub Pages and set the build directory to /docs/ &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#2---set-up-github-pages-and-set-the-build-directory-to-%2Fdocs%2F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up GitHub Pages for the respository &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.github.com/features/pages/&quot;&gt;as described here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &#39;Source&#39;, I picked the &#39;docs&#39; folder in the master branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/github-pages-settings.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub Pages settings&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3---tell-github-pages-i&#39;m-not-using-jekyll&quot;&gt;3 - Tell GitHub Pages I&#39;m not using Jekyll &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#3---tell-github-pages-i&#39;m-not-using-jekyll&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Pages seemed to be getting confused that I wasn&#39;t using Jekyll (I was getting build error emails). So &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#static-site-generators&quot;&gt;as described here&lt;/a&gt; I added a blank file called .nojekyll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/nojekyll.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adding .nojekyll file&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4---change-the-11ty-output-directory-to-%2Fdocs%2F&quot;&gt;4 - Change the 11ty output directory to /docs/ &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#4---change-the-11ty-output-directory-to-%2Fdocs%2F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing was working yet because Eleventy builds sites to the _site folder by default, whereas GitHub pages was looking for the /docs folder (see #2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I &lt;a href=&quot;https://v0-7-1.11ty.dev/docs/config/#output-directory&quot;&gt;followed the instructions here&lt;/a&gt; to change Eleventy&#39;s output folder. This is the relevant bit in eleventy.js:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;dir: {
      input: &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;, // was . //
      includes: &amp;quot;_includes&amp;quot;,
      data: &amp;quot;_data&amp;quot;,
      output: &amp;quot;docs&amp;quot; // was _site, I changed for github
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5---change-the-site-prefix&quot;&gt;5 - Change the site prefix &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#5---change-the-site-prefix&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I&#39;d pushed everything to GitHub, the site appeared on GitHub Pages! But it looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tomhiskey.co.uk/personal-site-11ty/img/eleventy-github-pages-site-prefix.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adding .nojekyll file&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to my CSS, my .js file and images were broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;https://v0-7-1.11ty.dev/docs/config/#deploy-to-a-subdirectory-with-a-path-prefix&quot;&gt;as described here&lt;/a&gt;, I headed back to eleventy.js and changed my site&#39;s path prefix to match my respository name. This is the relevant bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    pathPrefix: &amp;quot;/personal-site-11ty/&amp;quot;,  
    // I un-commented this and updated it to try and make github pages work
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5---change-the-path-for-images&quot;&gt;5 - Change the path for images &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#5---change-the-path-for-images&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fixed a lot, but not my .js file or images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I headed to base.njk and found the reference to the .js file. I added the URL prefix manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.e. I changed this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;/css/script.js&amp;quot; defer=&amp;quot;defer&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;/personal-site-11ty/css/script.js&amp;quot; defer=&amp;quot;defer&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the images, I did a find and replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found all instances of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/img/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and replaced them with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/personal-site-11ty/img/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That did the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a lot of time and Googling to figure out. I&#39;m not at all sure if it&#39;s a sensible method but it worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>There’s a feeling within the company I’m working for that I am – or should be – a graphic designer, as well as user experience specialist.</p>
<p>It got me thinking. Where do the two meet? Are they, in fact, one and the same, and I’ve been kidding myself that UX is a discipline distinct from graphic design?</p>
<p>As part of my current project, I am conducting moderated user tests, analysing data and producing a set of personas, red routes etc, to help my client understand its users and the tasks they want to perform – all standard UX fare.</p>
<p>That’s not design (not really), but I am also producing a set of specific recommendations regards visual language, navigation and layout. Plus, I’m building a prototype. ‘Design’ may be hard to define, but by any definition this is ‘design’.</p>
<p>Design is clearly a vital part of the UX process.</p>
<p>Within the context of UX, therefore, I do very much think of myself as a designer, and it’s a part of the process that I love.</p>
<p>However, I don’t necessarily think of myself as 100% graphic designer, in so far as there are certain design skills that tend to be outside the scope of UX. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing branding, logos and corporate identities;</li>
<li>Creating the look and feel of a company’s website and marketing material from scratch.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, particularly for clients with limited time and budgets, it’s a must for UX specialists to have design experience.</p>
<p>Just as these thoughts were swirling around in my mind, I received an email from <a href="http://nuxuk.org/">Norther User Experience</a> about a forthcoming talk – “The role of the graphic designer in the UXD process” – by Simon Jones, a Senior Lecturer Graphic Design at Leeds College of Art, at Simple Usability in Leeds.</p>
<p>Naturally, I popped along.</p>
<p>It confirmed what I knew I knew, that UX and graphic design are separate disciplines, but with significant overlap. It would be a foolish graphic designer that does not undertake at least a basic amount of user experience analysis (how could anyone design a website or app without an understanding of the users?). Similarly, it would be tough for a UX specialist to produce something for a client without any sort of design, even if in the form of paper prototypes or wireframes.</p>
<p>I considered flexing my Venn diagram muscles by way of illustration, but why bother when the very clever Janis Yee at <a href="http://PDX.ca">PDX.ca</a> has done such a good job?</p>
<p><img src="/personal-site-11ty/img/UX-Graphic-design-venn.png" alt="Infographic by Janis Yee at http://pdx.ca/"> <em>Infographic by Janis Yee at <a href="http://pdx.ca/">http://pdx.ca/</a></em></p>
<p>Check out Janis’s <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/55351/can-you-be-a-web-and-ux-designer-or-a-web-designer-with-ux-skills">blog post on the subject</a>.</p>
<p>The points of overlap in the diagram are important. From a UX perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UX/UI developer bit means I can produce working prototypes to showcase ideas to the client and users, and communicate effectively with the development team; and</li>
<li>The UX/UI designer bit means (as the infographic says), I can design layouts, visuals, etc, within the client’s brand values in mind. It also means that any visuals I produce are grounded in decent design principles, be it <a href="http://digestwebdesign.com/carp_design_principles.html">CARP</a>, colour, typography, use of space, usability, emotional response or whatever. This is surely important in terms of time, budget and results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question answered: UX and graphic design are separate disciplines, but there’s big overlap, and, as a UX specialist, design is an important part of what I do.</p>

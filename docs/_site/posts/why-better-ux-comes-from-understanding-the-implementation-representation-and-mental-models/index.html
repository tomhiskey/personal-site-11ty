<p>I’m a big fan of this diagram as a way of summing up the role of user experience in businesses:</p>
<p><img src="/img/UX-models-TPH-2015-09-231-720x391.png" alt="UX models - implementation, representation, mental"></p>
<p>It represents three models for software and service development: ‘implementation’, ‘representation’ and ‘mental’. Jargony, but simple to understand.</p>
<p>Any business that has developed software or services based on certain internal assumptions, and then seen the end product poorly received by users, may recognise <strong>the implementation model</strong>. Businesses following this model implement technology, products or services based on their own requirements and capabilities, without paying heed to their users. The result is (almost certainly) poor UX.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale is an end user’s idealised vision of a product or service. This is <strong>the mental model</strong>, the panacea that a user would sketch out on a napkin if they had free reign. Ultimate UX!</p>
<p>However, hitting the mental model sweet spot is usually impossible, because businesses will (rightly and inevitably) bring their own requirements and capabilities to the table.</p>
<p>The end result is usually in the middle of the spectrum – this is known as <strong>the representation model</strong>. It’s a balance between a user’s idealised vision and the realities of what can be built.</p>
<p>This isn’t a compromise; it’s a reality. It’s absolutely fine and proper to end up with this balance.</p>
<p>Critically, though, a UX-focused business will and should do two things.</p>
<p>First, start any design and development process at <strong>the right-hand side</strong> of the spectrum. Starting with the mental model puts the users’ vision at the forefront.</p>
<p>Second, strive to end up <strong>as close to the mental model as possible</strong>, to achieve the best possible result for users while satisfying businesses requirements.</p>
<p>Businesses without a UX mindset tend to operate in or around the implementation model. Their products and services often won’t resonate with customers.</p>
<p>Business that achieve fantastic UX get as close to the mental model as possible. They’re the ones on the right-hand side of the diagram, and the ones with delighted customers.</p>

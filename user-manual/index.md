It can be hard to get to know colleagues, but it's important because it helps us all work together better and feel more comfortable and engaged at work. I'm hoping this user manual (aka a [manual of me](https://manualofme.co/)) will help my colleagues get to know me.

I've been inspired to write one by the likes of [Dan](https://medium.com/@dasbarrett/a-user-manual-for-dan-d0a285874f72), [Cassie](https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694) and [Richard](https://medium.com/@mcleanonline/helping-other-people-get-to-know-you-aa2dbff5c0f8). 

## Conditions I like to work in
* A mix of office and home. Currently I work 2 days in the office, 3 at home, which is ok 
* A clean, tidy, modern, spacious environment
* A relaxed atmosphere
* Regular breaks - e.g. a wander in the rain for a coffee
* Flexible hours
* Working with kind, funny, thoughtful, interesting people
## The times / hours I like to work
* I used to hate mornings but now I'm a parent I've had to get used to it
* So I tend to start early (8:30) and finish on time
* But I'm still not at my best before 10am
## The best ways to communicate with me
* However you want - the important thing with a remote worker like me is simply that we _do_ communicate
* I avoid long Slack / email messages
* Person / webcam / phone over Slack for anything meaty
## The ways I like to receive feedback
* Regularly, openly and honestly
* I value negative and positive feedback equally
* Please don't wait to be asked - give me feedback whenever you have it, I value it greatly
## Things I need
* Purpose
* Collaboration
* Well-reasoned decisions
* Kindness
* Openness
* Praise and encouragement
* Honest, constructive criticism 
## Things I struggle with
* People who aren't culturally aligned with me (I find it tiring and I can get defensive, which I hate)
* People who send work messages when on annual leave (it drives me nuts)
* Loud voices
## Things I love
* Input from others in the design process - I'm not egotistical or precious, I see my role as getting the best outcomes, which means it doesn't have to be me coming up with all the ideas
* A team effort
* Multi-talented, interesting, creative, engaged colleagues
## Other things to know about me
* I often suffer from imposter syndrome
* I love learning
* I'm happiest when I can [bring my whole self to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd2WKQWG_Dg) - i.e. feel comfortable in my own skin
* Work-life balance is extremely important to me - I work best when it's in harmony
